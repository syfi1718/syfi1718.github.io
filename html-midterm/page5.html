        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>The first error in this code was that "DOCUTYPE HTML" was missing as Line 1. I added "DOCUTYPE" to Line 1.</li>
        <li>The second error in this code was that "html lang="en"" was missing as Line 2. I added "html lang="en"" to Line 2. </li>
        <li>The third error was that all meta information was missing at the beginning of this code. I added the meta information to the beginning of the code.</li>
        <li>The fourth error occured in Line 79. The closing tag for "em" was missing a "/" and the "m" in "em". I corrected the closing tag for "em" by adding "/" and an "m". </li>
        <li>The fifth error occured in Line 73. The closing tag for "p" was missing the "/", so I corrected the closing tag by adding "/".</li>

        <h2>Page Two</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Errors & Solutions: </p>

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>The first error in this code was an incorrect closing tag. The closing tag was missing the letter "b", so I corrected the closing tag by writing it correctly. </li>
        <li>The second error was due to incorrect indentation (logic error). I correctly indented lines 29-34 by tabbing both opening and closing paragraph tags one space to the left.</li>
        <li>The third error was for incorrect HTML writing. Headers cannot be on the inside of another tag, so on line 51 I deleted both the opening and closing "b" tags.</li>
        <li>The fourth error was due to intentional spaces in a "a hred". On Line 55, I changed "where do i go" in the "a hred" to "wheredoigo".</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Page Three</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Errors & Solutions: </p>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>The first error occurs in Line 51. The opening and closing tags need to be "li", not "l" I corrected the tags by writing "li" opening and closing tags.
        <li>The second error occurs in Line 80, there is an incorrectly typed closing tag for "td". The closing tag is missing the letters "td", so I added "td" in the closing tag.</li>
        <li>The third error occurs in Lines 95-97 (logic error). Before and after Line 96, the opening and closing tag of "tr" needs to be included. In addition, line 96 needs to be indented to match the rest of the code format.
            I wrote the opening and closing tag for "tr" and indented Line 96.
        </li>

    <h2>Page Four</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Errors & Solutions: </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>The first error in this code is at the very beginning. This code is missing "DOCTYPE HTML" on Line 1, so I correctly added it to Line 1.</li>
    <li>The second error occured for Lines 35, 36, 37, 40, 41, 42, 45, 46, and 47. Each line of code needed "alt" to be added and a brief description of the image to be vaild.
        I added "alt" and a brief description of each image to each listed line of code.
    </li>
    <li>The third error occured in Line 36. This line of code needed the closing tag for "td", so I correctly added the closing tag for "td".</li>
    <li>The fourth error occured in Line 41. This line of code needed both opening and closing tags of "td" around the line of code. I correctly added both tags.</li>
    <li>The fifth error occured at Line 46. The opening tag for "td" was missing, so I correctly added the opening tag for "td".</li>
    </ul>
