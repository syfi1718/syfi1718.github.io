        <h2>Page Two</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Errors & Solutions: </p>

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>The first error in this code was an incorrect closing tag. The closing tag was missing the letter "b", so I corrected the closing tag by writing it as "</b>". </li>
        <li>The second error was due to incorrect indentation (logic error). I correctly indented lines 29-34 by tabbing both opening and closing paragraph tags one space to the left.</li>
        <li>The third error was for incorrect HTML writing. Headers cannot be on the inside of another tag, so on line 51 I deleted both the opening and closing "b" tags.</li>
        <li>The fourth error was due to intentional spaces in a "a hred". On line 55, I changed "where do i go" in the "a hred" to "wheredoigo".</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Page Three</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Errors & Solutions: </p>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>The first error occurs in Line 51. The opening and closing tags need to be "li", not "l".
        <li>The second error occurs in Line 80, there is an incorrectly typed closing tag for "td". The closing tag is missing the letters "td", so the solution is to add "td" in the closing tag.</li>
        <li>The third error occurs in Line 95-97 (logic error). Before and after Line 96, the opening and closing tag of "tr" needs to be included. In addition, line 96 needs to be indented to match the rest of the code format.</li>
        </ul>
 
    <section id="pagefour"></section>
    <h2>Page Four</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Errors & Solutions: </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>The first error in this code is at the very beginning. This code is missing "DOCTYPE HTML" at Line 1, so I correctly added it to the code.</li>
    <li>The second error occured for Line 35, 36, 37, 40, 41, 42, 45, 46, and 47. Each line of code needed to add "alt" and a brief description of the image to be vaild.</li>
    <li>The third error occured in Line 36. This line of code needed the closing tag for "td", so I correctly added it.</li>
    <li>The fourth error occured in Line 41. This line of code needed both opening and closing tag of "td" around the line of code. I correctly added it.</li>
    <li>The fifth error occured at Line 46. The opening tag for "td" was missing, so I correctly added it.</li>
    </ul>
