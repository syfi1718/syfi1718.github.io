                "TikTok, deployed in China as Douyin (Chinese: 抖音; pinyin: Dǒuyīn), 
                 is a short-form video hosting service owned by the Chinese company 
                 ByteDance. It hosts user-submitted videos, which can range in duration 
                 from 15 seconds to 10 minutes. TikTok is an entirely separate, internationalized 
                 version of Douyin, which was released in the Chinese market in September 2016. 
                 It launched in 2017 for iOS and Android in most markets outside of mainland China; 
                 however, it became available worldwide only after merging with another Chinese social
                 media service, Musical.ly, on 2 August 2018. TikTok and Douyin have almost the same 
                 user interface but no access to each other's content. Their servers are each based in 
                 the market where the respective app is available. The two products are similar, 
                 but their features are not identical. Douyin includes an in-video search feature that 
                 can search by people's faces for more videos of them, along with other features such as 
                 buying, booking hotels, and making geo-tagged reviews. Since their launches, TikTok and 
                 Douyin have gained global popularity.In October 2020, TikTok surpassed 2 billion mobile 
                 downloads worldwide. Morning Consult named TikTok the third-fastest growing brand of 2020, 
                 after Zoom and Peacock. Cloudflare ranked TikTok the most popular website of 2021, 
                 surpassing google.com."

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The TikTok mobile app allows users to create short videos, which often feature music in the background and can be sped up, slowed down, or edited with a filter.[83] They can also add their own sound on top of the background music. 
            To create a music video with the app, users can choose background music from a wide variety of music genres, edit with a filter and record a 15-second video with speed adjustments before uploading it to share with others on TikTok or other social platforms.
            They can also film short lip-sync videos to popular songs. The "For You" page on TikTok is a feed of videos that are recommended to users based on their activity on the app. Content is generated by TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI)
            depending on the content a user liked, interacted with, or searched.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app's "react" feature allows users to film their reaction to a specific video, over which it is placed in a small window that is movable around the screen. Its "duet" feature allows users to film a video aside from another video.
            The "duet" feature was another trademark of musical.ly. The duet feature is also only able to be used if both parties adjust the privacy settings.
            Videos that users do not want to post yet can be stored in their "drafts." The user is allowed to see their "drafts" and post when they find it fitting. The app allows users to set their accounts as "private." When first downloading the app, 
            the user's account is public by default. The user can change to private in their settings. Private content remains visible to TikTok but is blocked from TikTok users who the account holder has not authorized to view their content. 
            Users can choose whether any other user, or only their "friends," may interact with them through the app via comments, messages, or "react" or "duet" videos. Users also can set specific videos to either "public," "friends only," or "private" 
            regardless if the account is private or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            In October 2021, TikTok launched a test feature that allows users to directly tip certain creators. Accounts of users that are of age, have at least 100,000 followers and agree to the terms can activate a "Tip" button on their profile, which allows followers to tip any amount, starting from $1.
            In December 2021, TikTok started beta-testing Live Studio, a streaming software that would let users broadcast applications open on their computers, including games. The software also launched with support for mobile and PC streaming. However, a few days later, users on Twitter discovered that the 
            software allegedly uses code from the open-source OBS Studio. OBS made a statement saying that, under the GNU GPL version 2, TikTok has to make the code of Live Studio publicly available if it wants to use any code from OBS.
            In May 2022, TikTok announced TikTok Pulse, an ad revenue-sharing program. It covers the "top 4% of all videos on TikTok" and is only available to creators with more than 100,000 followers. If an eligible creator's video reaches the top 4%, they will receive a 50% share of the revenue from ads displayed with the video.

        <h2>Content and Usage</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            TikTok tends to appeal to younger users, as 41% of its users are between the ages of 16 and 24. These individuals are considered Generation Z or Gen Z and this audience is part of the generation that grew up in a world filled with internet. Since they grew up surrounded by the internet, social media has become 
            a part of their daily life. Among these TikTok users, 90% say they use the app daily. TikTok's geographical use has shown that 43% of new users are from India. As of the first quarter of 2022, there were over 100 million monthly active users in the United States and 23 million in the UK. The average user, daily,
            was spending 1 hour and 25 minutes on the app and opening TikTok 17 times.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app has spawned numerous viral trends, Internet celebrities, and music trends around the world. Many stars got their start on musical.ly, which merged with TikTok on 2 August 2018. These users include Loren Gray, Baby Ariel, Kristen Hancher, Zach King, Lisa and Lena, Jacob Sartorius, and many others. 
            Loren Gray remained the most-followed individual on TikTok until Charli D'Amelio surpassed her on 25 March 2020. Gray's was the first TikTok account to reach 40 million followers on the platform. She was surpassed with 41.3 million followers. D'Amelio was the first to ever reach 50, 60, and 70 million 
            followers. Charli D'Amelio remained the most-followed individual on the platform until she was surpassed by Khaby Lame on June 23, 2022. Other creators rose to fame after the platform merged with musical.ly on 2 August 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            While TikTok has primarily been used for entertainment purposes, TikTok may soon have another use, that of a job resource with the idea that prospective employment seekers would send in videos rather than traditional resumes. The form would most likely be a job search add-on. TikTok has had favorable 
            results in the past with people using the site to find jobs and may be expanding that need, especially in the newer generations.

        <h2>Addiction Concerns</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            There are concerns that some users may find it hard to stop using TikTok. In April 2018, an addiction-reduction feature was added to Douyin. This encouraged users to take a break every 90 minutes. Later in 2018, the feature was rolled out to the TikTok app. TikTok uses some top influencers such as Gabe Erwin, Alan Chikin Chow, James Henry, and Cosette Rinab to encourage viewers to stop using the app and take a break.
            Many were also concerned with the app affecting users' attention spans due to the short-form nature of the content. This is a concern as many of TikTok's audience are younger children, whose brains are still developing. TikTok executives and representatives have noted and made aware to advertisers on the platform that users have poor attention spans. With a large amount of video content, nearly 50% of users find 
            it stressful to watch a video longer than a minute and a third of users watch videos at double speed. In June 2022, TikTok introduced the ability to set a maximum uninterrupted screen time allowance, after which the app blocks off the ability to navigate the feed. The block only lifts after the app is exited and left unused for a set period of time. Additionally, the app features a dashboard with statistics on how 
            often the app is opened, how much time is spent browsing it and when the browsing occurs.

        <h2>Content Concerns</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Concerns have been voiced regarding content relating to, and the promotion and spreading of, hateful words and far-right extremism, such as anti-semitism, racism, and xenophobia. Some videos were shown to expressly deny the existence of the Holocaust and told viewers to take up arms and fight in the name of white supremacy and the swastika. As TikTok has gained popularity among young children, and the popularity of 
            extremist and hateful content is growing, calls for tighter restrictions on their flexible boundaries have been made. TikTok has since released tougher parental controls to filter out inappropriate content and to ensure they can provide sufficient protection and security. The Wall Street Journal has reported that doctors experienced a surge in reported cases of tics, tied to an increasing number of TikTok videos from 
            content creators with Tourette syndrome. Doctors suggested that the cause may be a social one as users who consumed content showcasing various tics would sometimes develop tics of their own.
