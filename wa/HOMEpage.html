    <h1>HOME</h1>

    <p>Hi there, thanks for visting my site. Since you clicked "HOME", I assume you'd like to get to know me. 
        For a brief introduction, I am a recent graduate from The University of Colorado, Boulder. During my college career, I majored in Advertising and minored
    in Creative Technology and Design. I excelled in my academics, as I am (proudly) no stranger to the Dean's List and found a 
    genuine passion for learning along the way. On a personal note, I made several life long friends, discovered new 
    hobbies, new favorite foods, new goals, and essentially became my own person. Its safe to say that i'm looking forward to my early career and fueling my admiration for learning!
 </p>

    <p><em>As I have lived in Colorado my whole life, I am looking forward to moving to the great city of Chicago this fall. 
        As much as I adore Boulder (and I really do adore it), I'm ready for a change. I'm thrilled to see where following 
        my dreams of living in the city lights takes me.
