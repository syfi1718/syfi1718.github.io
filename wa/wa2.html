        <p>Hi! My name is Sydney. My pronouns are she, her, and hers.</p>
    </div>
        <p>My goals for this course are to broaden my coding skills and experience for my career. </p> 
        <p>I will be graduating in May and look forward to my first "real world" job! </p>
        <p>Although, I will deeply miss CU Boulder. College has brought me my best friends and memories. </p>
        <p>I hope to make the most out of this semester, academically and socially. </p>
