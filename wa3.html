                "TikTok, deployed in China as Douyin (Chinese: 抖音; pinyin: Dǒuyīn), 
                 is a short-form video hosting service owned by the Chinese company 
                 ByteDance. It hosts user-submitted videos, which can range in duration 
                 from 15 seconds to 10 minutes. TikTok is an entirely separate, internationalized 
                 version of Douyin, which was released in the Chinese market in September 2016. 
                 It launched in 2017 for iOS and Android in most markets outside of mainland China; 
                 however, it became available worldwide only after merging with another Chinese social
                 media service, Musical.ly, on 2 August 2018. TikTok and Douyin have almost the same 
                 user interface but no access to each other's content. Their servers are each based in 
                 the market where the respective app is available. The two products are similar, 
                 but their features are not identical. Douyin includes an in-video search feature that 
                 can search by people's faces for more videos of them, along with other features such as 
                 buying, booking hotels, and making geo-tagged reviews. Since their launches, TikTok and 
                 Douyin have gained global popularity.In October 2020, TikTok surpassed 2 billion mobile 
                 downloads worldwide. Morning Consult named TikTok the third-fastest growing brand of 2020, 
                 after Zoom and Peacock. Cloudflare ranked TikTok the most popular website of 2021, 
                 surpassing google.com."
